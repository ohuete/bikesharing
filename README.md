# CitiBike (bikeshare program)
## Background & Purpose
After spending the summer in New York City with a friend, we came up with the idea of bringing a bikeshare program, like CitiBike, to our hometown Des Moines, Iowa. To do so, we gathered data from New York City's very own CitiBike bikeshare program to know exactly how the business operates. Once the investigation was complete, we made a proposal on how a program like this could work in De Moines. I used Tableau to create data visualizations on our data and with that, create a story that reflects our business proposal.

## Results
1.) Data collection on checkout times for users. This provides information on number of bikes and trip duration. We see that the bikes are only being used for brief periods of time and probably locally. (See image below)

2.) We took a look at gender checkout times. This gives us an idea of who the major subscribers are. From the chart below, we see that MALE subscribers use the bikeshare services the most.

3.) We figured out what time of day throughout the week is the program most active. The heatmap below indicates bikes are being used in the morning and evening hours the most. We can infer that people are mostly using the program to get to and from work.

4.) Similar to our previous finding, the next heatmap is gendered; once again providing a sense of who is utilizing the services the most and during what time of day. As seen before, MALE is using the service more than FEMALE.

5.) The last data visualization is basically both previous heatmaps together, except we're looking at a weekly report. Still, MALE is using the services more than FEMALE. This weekly heatmap report indicated that MALE uses the program the most towards the end of the week. Perhaps, end of the week increases nightlife and people would rather bike than drive.

## Summary
The CitiBike program is extremely successful in New York City. It is affordable, accessible, and convenient. People actively utilize the services of the program. Based on the evidence gathered, our primary customer target will be the MALE demographic. We also know that people may prefer this method of city transportation. Whether it is used to commute to/from work or when going out to social gatherings. Another key piece of information is trip duration, because this may be indicative of how much maintenance is required. Knowing when the program is most active also provides an idea on when would be the best time to provide maintenance on the bikes.
